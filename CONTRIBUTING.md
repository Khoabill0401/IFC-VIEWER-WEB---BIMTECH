# Topics

Here's some stuff we need help on:

### New BIM tools

- This repository is a collection of tools to facilitate the creation of cool BIM applications in a short time. If you have tools in mind that we haven't implemented yet, you can propose them to the community and submit them via PR. The more, the merrier!

### Docs

* New tutorials of web-ifc-viewer in the [official documentation](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Guide/web-ifc-viewer/Introduction).

### Testing and CI/CD
* We are setting up the tests for this project right now. You can help us make the tests better, add new tests, etc. 
* Automate PR check, deploy, versioning, etc with github actions.


This list is pretty open and there are much more things that could be improved!
If you need help getting started come find us in the [discord channel](https://discord.gg/FXfyR4XrKT).

If you have an idea that's not on the list, please tell us about it so we can discuss if we want it in the repo.

# Process

We don't really have a fixed process yet, so don't worry to much. Just make sure we know what you're doing :)

Whenever you're ready, make a PR with a good name. We will take a look asap.

Thanks!
